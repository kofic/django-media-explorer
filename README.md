#Installation

##Install

Run this command:

```
pip install django-media-explorer
```

NOTE: If you want to use a virtual environment then run the following commands:

```
virtualenv dme
cd dme
source bin/activate
pip install django-media-explorer
```

##Update settings

Add these to your INSTALLED_APPS settings

```
    'boto3',
    'rest_framework',
    'micawber.contrib.mcdjango',
    'media_explorer',
    'ckeditor',
```

Add these to your urls.py

```
    url("^ckeditor/", include("ckeditor.urls")),
    url("^", include("media_explorer.urls")),
```

Copy and paste this code into the bottom of your settings.py file.

```
try:
    from media_explorer.settings import *
except ImportError:
    pass

```

Here are the DME application settings you need. Put them somewhere in your settings.py file (after the "media_explorer.settings" import).

```
#The DME application will try to resize your images 
#during your upload unless you set to False
#Default is True
DME_RESIZE = False
```

These settings controls DME Admin JQuery loading (since v0.3.6).

```
#If you use your own JQuery in your admin pages and you do not want 
#the DME application JQuery to conflict with yours then set to False
#Default is True
DME_INCLUDE_JQUERY = False
```

Update these AWS settings to upload to S3 (since v0.4)

```
DME_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "xxx"
DME_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "xxx"
DME_S3_BUCKET = "xxx"
#Default is us-east-1
DME_S3_REGION = "us-east-1"
DME_S3_FOLDER = "path/to/my/s3/file/"

#Default is False
DME_UPLOAD_TO_S3 = True

```

Update these AWS settings to delete from S3 when you delete an Element or ResizedImage object (since v0.4)
```
#Default is False
DME_DELETE_FROM_S3 = True
```

Likewise update these settings to delete from local server when you delete an Element or ResizedImage object (since v0.4)
```
#Default is False
DME_DELETE_FROM_LOCAL = True
```

##Create tables

Run these migration commands to create your database tables.

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

#Dependencies

Pip should install all the dependencies for you but if you prefer to install DME manually then be aware of these dependencies.

This version (0.4) is for Django 1.7+

Other dependencies are:
- [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) (version 3.1.2)
- [Micawber](https://github.com/coleifer/micawber) (version 0.3.3)
- [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) (version 2.6.1+)
- [CKEditor](https://github.com/ckeditor) (version 4.4.8)

Additionally Pillow has some platform dependencies. For instance if you are on Centos then you may need to run these commands before you install.

```
sudo yum install "Development Tools"
sudo yum install python-devel
sudo yum install libjpeg-devel
sudo yum install zlib-devel
```


#Tests

Run this command to run all the DME tests.

NOTE: The tests force DME_UPLOAD_TO_S3=False and DME_DELETE_FROM_S3=False.

```
python manage.py test media_explorer.tests
```

Or you can run the tests individually.

```
python manage.py test media_explorer.tests.elements.tests
python manage.py test media_explorer.tests.galleries.tests
python manage.py test media_explorer.tests.customfields.tests
```

#How it works

Go to https://github.com/oxfamamerica/media_explorer_example to download and run the example blog application.

Let's say you have a blog model that looks like this:
```
from django.db import models

class Blog(models.Model):
    """
    Example Blog model
    """
    title = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    entry = models.TextField(blank=True,null=True)


```

You can now add media to your blog by adding the MediaImageField, MediaField and RichTextField fields.

```
from django.db import models
from media_explorer.fields import MediaImageField, MediaField, RichTextField


class Blog(models.Model):
    """
    Example Blog model
    """

    title = models.CharField(max_length=150)

    #Since v0.3.6
    #This behaves exactly as Django's ImageField with following differences:
    #1) You can add an optional max_upload_size=xxx to limit upload size
    #2) After image is saved you can see it listed at http://YOUR-DJANGO-SITE-URL/media_explorer
    #3) If the setting DME_RESIZE = True then image will be resized
    my_image = MediaImageField(max_upload_size=5242880,upload_to="my_dir")

    #Since v0.3.0
    #If you do not provide a type then media can be image/video/gallery
    lead_media = MediaField()

    #Since v0.3.0
    #Providing a type will restrict the element to this type
    video = MediaField(type="video")

    #Since v0.3.0
    #Entry is changed from TextField to RichTextField
    #You will see a CKEditor WYSIWYG with DME plugin
    #NOTE: You cannot use more than one RichText field in a model
    entry = RichTextField()
```

After you add media fields to your model you can add data via the admin page ([See screenshot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.oxfamamerica.org/images/github/add_blog.png) - the red-circled button is the DME plugin button. It will allow you to insert media elements into your WYSIWYG)

After you add media you can access them by going to http://YOUR-DJANGO-SITE-URL/media_explorer/ ([See screenshot](http://media.oxfamamerica.org.s3.amazonaws.com/images/github/dme-images.jpg)).

You can add data programatically like this.

```

import os
from media_explorer.models import Element, Gallery, GalleryElement
from django.core.files import File

#Importing the Blog defined above
from blog.models import Blog

#Read your local image into my_file
my_file = open(path_to_local_image_file,"rb")

#Create an image element
image = Element()
image.name = "My image"
image.image.save(os.path.basename(my_file.name),File(my_file), save=True)

#Create a video element
video = Element()
video.video_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBupSKjSQM0"
video.save()

#Create a gallery
gallery = Gallery()
gallery.name = "My gallery"
gallery.save()

#Add gallery elements
ge = GalleryElement()
ge.gallery = gallery
ge.element = image
ge.credit = "My image credit"
ge.description = "My image caption"
ge.sort_by = 0
ge.save()

ge2 = GalleryElement()
ge2.gallery = gallery
ge2.element = video
ge2.sort_by = 1
ge2.save()

#NOTE: If you go to your http://YOUR-DJANGO-SITE-URL/media_explorer link - you should see all the media you added above on the Media Explorer page.


#Add media to blog
blog = Blog()
blog.title = "My first blog"
blog.lead_media = gallery
blog.video = video
blog.save()

#NOTE: This will fail because you set video field to type="video"
blog.video = image
blog.save()

```

If you provide the blog object (defined above) to your page - then your template may look like this.

```
{% load media_explorer_tags %}

{% if blog.lead_media.type == "video" %}
    {% get_video blog.lead_media.id %}
{% elif blog.lead_media.type == "gallery" %}
    {% get_media_gallery blog.lead_media.id %}
{% elif blog.lead_media.type == "image" %}
    <img src="{% get_image_url_from_size blog.lead_media.id "1220x763" "1220x762" "orig_c"|safe %}" alt="">
    {% if blog.lead_media.caption or blog.lead_media.credit %}
    <figcaption>
        {% if blog.lead_media.caption %}
            {{blog.lead_media.caption}}
        {% endif %}
        {% if blog.lead_media.credit %}
            {{blog.lead_media.credit}}
        {% endif %}
    </figcaption>
    {% endif %}
{% endif %}

{% get_video blog.video.id %}

{% if blog.entry %}{{ blog.entry | show_short_code | safe }}{% endif %}

```

#CHANGELOG

##v0.4
- Added capability to upload to S3 by setting DME_UPLOAD_TO_S3=True
- Django Rest Framework upgraded to 3.1.2 since Django 1.9+ no longer provides **django.utils.datastructures.MergeDict** and **django.core.handlers.wsgi.STATUS_CODE_TEXT**.
- Mcawber upgraded to 0.3.3 since Django 1.9+ no longer provides **django.utils.importlib.import_module**.

##v0.3.11
- Replacing file._size with file.size in media_explorer.fields since file._size is not available when the object has already been created.

- Fix for the last resized image being overritten.

##v0.3.9
Adding 'manual_embed_code' field to allow for manually entering video embed code in the backend. When this is true DME will not automatically try to get the embed code.

##v0.3.6

- Fix for issue: https://github.com/oxfamamerica/django-media-explorer/issues/5
- Fix for issue: https://github.com/oxfamamerica/django-media-explorer/issues/6
- Introduced DME_INCLUDE_JQUERY setting to fix issue #6 above. Set it to False if you are using your own version of JQuery and you do not want DME's version to conflict with yours.
- You can now use DME custom model field MediaImageField. The MediaField saves the image/video, caption and credits information into a JSON field. What if you already use Django's FileField/ImageField but you want your image to be listed in [DME](http://media.oxfamamerica.org.s3.amazonaws.com/images/github/dme-images.jpg) and you do not want to refactor your code so the ImageField is changed to A JSON field. For this use case you can replace your Django FileField/ImageField with DME's MediaImageField. 

##v0.3.5

Minor documentation fixes

##v0.3.4

Fix for issue: https://github.com/oxfamamerica/django-media-explorer/issues/4

##v0.3.3

Fix for issue: https://github.com/oxfamamerica/django-media-explorer/issues/3

##v0.3.2

- Documentation updated to include new example app that can be used to demo DME.

##v0.3.1

- The micawber module failed to the test for the latest version of Django (1.9.1) and the problem has to do with django.utils.importlib (used by micawber) being removed from Django 1.9+ - so support for Django 1.9 has been temporaily removed.

##v0.3.0

- You can now use DME custom model fields (MediaField and RichTextField) in your models.
- You could previously only use one media field on a page - now you can have as many media fields as you want.
- When you select an image to insert into a richtext field, via the admin page, a list of the current image sizes are listed - so you no longer have to guess which size is available.

[Documentation](https://github.com/oxfamamerica/django-media-explorer/blob/master/README_v0.3.md)

##v0.2.0
You can now use DME with Django 1.7+

[Documentation](https://github.com/oxfamamerica/django-media-explorer/blob/master/README_v0.2.md)

##v0.1.0
[Documentation](https://github.com/oxfamamerica/django-media-explorer/blob/master/README_v0.1.md)

#TODO
- ~~Add capability to save to AWS S3~~
- ~~Upgrade to latest Django version (Currently works on 1.7+ and 1.8+) - Add support for 1.9+~~
